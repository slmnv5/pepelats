# Pepelats - Audio looper and drum machine on Raspberry Pi

### Looper

- Multiple song parts (intro/verse/chorus/bridge). Each part consists of any number of parallel loops
- Parallel loops of variable length: 1, 2, 3 ... of the 1-st loop in a part
- Using attached screen or web page as looper monitor
- Three drum types synchronized to the looper
- Quantization - loop's length is adjusted to bar length or another loop length
- Full history of "undo/redo" for each part, not only the latest change
- Parts and their loops may be deleted/cleared on the run
- Silencing and re-arranging of loops in song parts
- Loading saving of songs
- Delay tolerance - late switching of loops by 0.1 sec. or less is acceptable
- Binary distribution. Installation and configuration simplified


### Looper control and display

- Display looper state in attached screen (ex. 3.5" LCD screen) or in a web browser
- Control of looper via MIDI or computer keyboard
- User configurable menu files. Number of song parts and MIDI controller buttons may be changed
- Scrollable lists to select options using MIDI control

### Drum machine

- Drum machine with tree drum types: Style, MIDI and Loop
- Style patterns and MIDI commands are plain text files easy to edit
- Drums have volume control, random variations and can play breaks/fills
- MIDI drum may sync and control external MIDI device, good for IOS drums.
- Style drum is pattern based, have adjustable swing parameter
- Loop drum uses the first song part as drums, good for beatboxing
