# Pepelats - Audio looper and drum machine on Raspberry Pi
 

### Looper

- Multiple song parts (intro/verse/chorus/...). Parts have any number of parallel loops
- Parallel loops of variable length
- Quantization - loop's length, start/stop time is adjusted
- Full history of "undo/redo" for each part
- Parts may be cleared, loops may be deleted on the run
- Silencing and re-arranging of loops in a part
- Loading, saving of songs
- Delay tolerance - allows switching late up to 0.1s
- Binary distribution, installation is simple

### Looper control and display

- Display looper state in attached screen (ex. 3.5" LCD screen) or in a web browser
- Control of looper via MIDI or computer keyboard
- User configurable menu files: number of song parts, MIDI commands, etc

### Drum machine

- Drum machine with tree drum types: Style, MIDI and Loop
- MIDI drum may sync and control external MIDI client, e.g. IOS app
- Style drum is pattern based
- Loop drum uses one song part as drums
- Style patterns and MIDI commands are plain text files easy to edit
- Drums have volume control, swing parameter, variations and breaks/fills
