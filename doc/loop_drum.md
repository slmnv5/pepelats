## Loop drum

**Loop drum** is recorded song part that plays along all the time (though it may be muted).
As any song part **Loop drum** may have several parallel loops.    
**Loop drum** is randomized by muting some of these parallel loops. Drum fill is implemented by playing the very last
loop that must be recorded as drum fill. When drum fill is not playing this latest loop is always muted.

IMPORTANT. By convention **Loop drum** always uses part #0 (top most on screen).
