## Loop drum

**Loop drum** is recorded song part that plays along all the time (though it may be muted).
As any song part **Loop drum** may have several parallel loops.    
**Loop drum** is randomized by muting all parallel loops except of one. The very
last loop is played as drum fill, all other loops are varions of rythm selected randomly. By convention **Loop drum**
always uses part #0 (top most on screen).
