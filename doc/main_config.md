## Main configuration

INI file **[local.ini](../local.ini)** has several sections that define configuration of the looper. Edit this file
to change default configurations. Thus you may change names of MIDI or audio devices or switch between using
LCD screen and web to output lopper's state.

If you ever lose this file or loose some settings in this file look at
[main.ini](../main.ini) that contains all defaul configurations.  
There are comments that explain each option in each section.
