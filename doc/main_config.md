## Main configuration

INI file **[local.ini](../local.ini)** has several sections that define configuration of the looper. Edit this file
to change default configurations. Thus, you may change names of MIDI or audio devices.

If you ever lose this file or loose some settings in this file look at
[main.ini](../main.ini) that contains all default configurations.  
There are comments that explain each option in each section.
