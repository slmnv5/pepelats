## Main configuration

File **[user.ini](../user.ini)** has several sections that define configuration of the looper. Edit this file
to change default configurations. Thus, you may change names of MIDI or audio devices, MIDI notes used and number of
MIDI notes used

If you need example of specific configuration look at [main.ini](../main.ini) that contains all default
configurations. There are comments that explain each option in each section.
