## Euclid drum

**Euclid drum** rhythms use four parameters: steps, beats, offset and accent.

- Steps - length (or period) of the pattern.
- Beats - how many drum hits there are in one period. All beats are spread most evenly over all steps.
- Offset - position of first beat.
- Accent - how many steps have accented sound, e.g. if accent = 3 each 3-rd step is accented.

Euclid drums make very long non-repeating patterns using very simple notation. As an example 208 step long
sequence for bass drum (bd) and snare drum (sd) is shown below. Note that 208 = 13 * 16 and 13, 16 are mutually prime
numbers.

bd : 16, 4, 0, 0
sd : 13, 8, 0, 0
