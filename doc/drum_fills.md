### Drum fills

There are two drum intensity levels for Style and Euclidean drums - normal and break.
Patterns are split into 2 groups based on name -- if pattern name contans string "brk" it is a break pattern and used
only to play drum breaks.

### Drum variations

Drums type have smaller variability when at start of the bar there is some probability of specific drums to be
silenced (
e.g. hi-hat). Probability of variations is fixed Pattern and Euclid drums and is a parameter for Loop drum

### Drum swing

Pattern and Euclid drums have a swing parameter when each even step is delayed.
