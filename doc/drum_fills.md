### Drum fills

There are two drum intensity levels for Pattern and Euclidean drums. At the start all patterns are sorted by
intensity (or energy) of drum accompaniment. Pattern energy depends on number of drum hits, specific sounds used energy
and accents.

After sorting patterns by energy they are split into 2 groups - quiet and loud. Loud patterns used to play drum fills.

### Drum variations

Drums type have smaller variability when at start of the bar there is some probability of specific drums to be
silenced (
e.g. hi-hat). Probability of variations is fixed Pattern and Euclid drums and is a parameter for Loop drum

### Drum swing

Pattern and Euclid drums have a swing parameter when each even step is delayed.
