## Looper views

There are 4 looper views: play, song, drum, service  
Each view has INI file that configures available MIDI messages and respective commands

* [play view](../config/menu/6-4-menu/play.ini) -- play / record / overdub / clear song parts and switching between
  them. Loops for each song part can be seen and edited as well

  or load song. Scroll list of saved songs

  specific style for style drum

* [service view](../config/menu/6-4-menu/serv.ini) -- restart looper, check for updates. Select drum type
