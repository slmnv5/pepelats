<h3>Hardware required</h3>
Raspberry Pi versions: Zero-2W, 3B+, 4, 5

<p></p>

<h3>Looper features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Multiple song parts (intro/verse/chorus/...). Parts have any
        number of parallel loops</li>
    <li>Parallel loops of variable length. Loops play together inside
        song part unless some of the loops are muted</li>
    <li>Quantization, loop's length, start/stop time is adjusted.
        Example: If a new loop is not exactly 2 bars log it will be
        truncated or extended with silence.</li>
    <li>Full history of undo/redo for each part. When adding new loop
        all saved undone loops, if any, are deleted – this is the only way
        to keep it simple.
    </li>
    <li>Parts may be cleared, loops may be deleted on the run. There
        are two different views for parts and loops.</li>
    <li>Silencing, deleting and re-arranging of loops in a part. A
        loop from the middle may be moved to the end to become the first
        loop to undo.</li>
    <li>Loading, saving of songs. Songs saved along with their drums.</li>
    <li>Delay tolerance – allows switching late up to 0.1s</li>
    <li>Binary distribution, installation is simple. License is
        required for full functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Looper control and display</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Display looper state in attached screen (ex. 3.5&quot; LCD
        screen) or in a web browser. Web browser is preferable as you can
        edit configuration. Screen is more convenient if you have small
        screen attached to looper and do never change configuration.
    </li>
    <li>Control of looper via MIDI or computer keyboard.</li>
    <li>User configurable menu files: number of song parts, MIDI
        commands, etc. Menu is just a text file – you can look to
        understand what buttons do.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drum machine</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Drum machine with tree drum types: Style, MIDI and Loop</li>
    <li>MIDI drum may sync and control external MIDI client, e.g. IOS
        app. Midi clock is not supported, it may use start/stop, song
        position, and sys-ex messages to synchronize.</li>
    <li>Style patterns and MIDI commands are plain text files easy to
        edit. Style pattern looks like step sequencer in a text file.
    </li>
    <li>Loop drum uses one song part as drums. It plays along with
        other parts unless is stopped.</li>
    <li>All drums have volume control, random variations and
        breaks/fills</li>
</ul>
