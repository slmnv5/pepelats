<p>Features of the looper are listed below and explained more details
in specific documents.</p>
<h3>Looper features</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Multiple song parts (intro/verse/chorus/...). Parts have any
	number of parallel loops</p></li>
	<li><p>Parallel loops of variable length. Loops play together inside
	song part unless some of the loops are muted</p></li>
	<li><p>Quantization, loop's length, start/stop time is adjusted.
	Example: If a new loop is not exactly 2 bars log it will be
	truncated or extended with silence.</p></li>
	<li><p>Full history of undo/redo for each part. When adding new loop
	all saved undone loops, if any, are deleted – this is the only way
	to keep it simple. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Parts may be cleared, loops may be deleted on the run. There
	are two different views for parts and loops.</p></li>
	<li><p>Silencing, deleting and re-arranging of loops in a part. A
	loop from the middle may be moved to the end to become the first
	loop to undo.</p></li>
	<li><p>Loading, saving of songs. Songs saved along with their drums.</p></li>
	<li><p>Delay tolerance – allows switching late up to 0.1s</p></li>
	<li><p>Binary distribution, installation is simple. License is
	required for full functionality.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Looper control and display</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Display looper state in attached screen (ex. 3.5&quot; LCD
	screen) or in a web browser. Web browser is preferable as you can
	edit configuration. Screen is more convenient if you have small
	screen attached to looper and do never change configuration. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Control of looper via MIDI or computer keyboard.</p></li>
	<li><p>User configurable menu files: number of song parts, MIDI
	commands, etc. Menu is just a text file – you can look to
	understand what buttons do.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Drum machine</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Drum machine with tree drum types: Style, MIDI and Loop</p></li>
	<li><p>MIDI drum may sync and control external MIDI client, e.g. IOS
	app. Midi clock is not supported, it may use start/stop, song
	position, and sys-ex messages to synchronize.</p></li>
	<li><p>Style patterns and MIDI commands are plain text files easy to
	edit. Style pattern looks like step sequencer in a text file. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Loop drum uses one song part as drums. It plays along with
	other parts unless is stopped.</p></li>
	<li><p>All drums have volume control, random variations and
	breaks/fills</p></li>
</ul>
