<p>Menu configuration is a simple INI file that does two things:
    1) translates MIDI notes into looper commands and 2) shows looper state.
</p>
<p>
    To do this it contains MIDI messages and respective commands.
    Besides that each menu has view description and command to display looper state.
    There are 3 menu configurations tah you may look at to understand more.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>[<a href="../config/menu/play.ini">play.ini</a>] -- play /
        record / overdub / clear song parts and switching between them. Show
        loops for song parts. Silence, delete, re-arrange loops. Stop
        playing</li>
    <li>[<a href="../config/menu/song.ini">song.ini</a>] - delete,
        save, initialize or load song. Select drum configuration.</li>
    <li>[<a href="../config/menu/serv.ini">serv.ini</a>] -- Restart
        looper on web or on screen. Select drum type (Style, MIDI, Loop),
        adjust drum volume and parameters. Check hardware ID and license
        information</li>
</ul>
<p>Each view may have several sections that provide different options
    and MIDI commands.
</p>
<p>As an example play view has section [play.0] to work with song
    parts and [play.1] to work with loops inside one part. Also note that
    there may be multiple commands separated by colon (:) assigned to one
    button.</p>
<p>To know how buttons are making MIDI commands look at

    below it there is description that shows available commands in specific view.
