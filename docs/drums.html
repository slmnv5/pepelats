<p>Looper has embedded drum machine that may use different drums: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>[<a href="style_drum.html">Style drum</a>] - using text
	patterns - with drum names, steps and accents</p></li>
	<li><p>[<a href="midi_drum.html">MIDI drum</a>] - using
	configurations to send MID commands (stop, set BPM, start of loop,
	etc.)</p></li>
	<li><p>[<a href="loop_drum.html">Loop drum</a>] - using the first
	song part as a drum and part's loops as drum variations</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Drum break/fill</h3>
<p>There are two drum intensity levels for drums – normal and
break/fill. Different types of drums implement breaks as described
here. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>For Style drum patterns are split into 2 groups based on the
	name – if pattern name contains string &quot;<b>brk</b>&quot; it
	is used for breaks only. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>For Loop drum – depending on style a break may be 1) the
	last recorded loop or 2) all loops playing together.</p></li>
	<li><p>For MIDI drum break/fill may be configured in INI file by
	sending specific MIDI command. This command may be program change or
	other command specific for your midi device. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
